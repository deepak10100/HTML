    <title>The Motherday Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is a Motherday Website</h1>
    <p>And it's mother Perfect</p>
    <h2>Seriously, what the fuck else do you want?</h2>
    <p>You probably build website and think your shit is special. You magabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some motherday Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of you can glue to the corner of your site. You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 Polyfills give IE7 a biner because it finally has box-shodow. Wrong mother day. Let me describe your perfect-ass website:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>shit's lighweight and loads fast</li>
        <li>Fits on all your shitty screens</li>
        <li>Looks the same in all yout shitty brower</li>
        <li>The Motherday's accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
        <li>Shit's legible and gets your fucking point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>well guess what, motherday:</h2>
    <p>You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this shit. It's a motherfucking website. Why the fuck do you need to animate a fucking trendy-ass banner flag when I hover over that useless piece of shit? You spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your fucking site, and some motherday jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will never see that shit. Not to mention blind people will never see that shit, but they don't see any of your shitty shit.</p>
   
    <p>You never knew it, but this is your perfect website.Here's why</p>
    <h1>It's motherday lightweight</h1>
    <p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your fucking Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the fucking background color of a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a shitty webfont just so you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You piece of shit.</p>
    <h1>It's responsive</h1>
    <p>You dumbass. You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever motherfucking screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a motherfucking Tamagotchi.</p>
    <h2>Yes, this is motherday satire, you day</h2>
    <p>I'm not actually saying your shitty site should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are <strong>ones we create ourselves.</strong> str Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them. You son-of-a-bitch.</p>
    <q>Good design is a n little design as possible</q>
